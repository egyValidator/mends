    <p>What is a developer portfolio?
      A developer portfolio is a website that showcases the work that you’ve done as a developer. The idea is borrowed
      from the art world: photographers, for example, will often create a portfolio website that showcases their best
      work.
      The goal of a developer portfolio is to present yourself and your work in the best possible light. Your portfolio
      should make employers excited to meet you. It should offer a glimpse into how awesome it would be to work with
      you!
      Unless you already have extensive work experience, your side projects are the greatest asset you have.   They are
      your trophies, and the portfolio site is the trophy case that highlights all the amazing stuff you’ve done.
      Building side projects is a lot of work, and we want to make sure to squeeze as much job - seeking value out of
      them!
